## Summary

Backend developer with 5 years of professional Python experience and a prior background in C++/IoT. I strive to build maintainable, observable systems, and enjoy working with data, AI integration, and developer-facing tools. I work best in small to medium, thoughtful teams with strong communication and clear ownership. Remote-only. Asynchronous-first teams preferred.

Strong experience with FastAPI, PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy, Alembic), Docker, GitHub Actions, and AWS Lambda/ECS. Considerable exposure to OpenXML and `.docx` generation (via `python-docx`, `html2docx`, and XML manipulation). Familiar with frontend codebases (React/TypeScript), observability tooling (Grafana, DataDog), and prompt-tuned OpenAI LLMs (via LlamaIndex).
