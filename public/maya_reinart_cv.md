## Summary

Backend developer with 4+ years of professional Python experience and a prior background in C++/IoT. I focus on building maintainable, observable systems — especially around structured data, templating pipelines, and developer-facing tools. I work best on small, thoughtful teams with strong communication and clear ownership. Remote-only. Asynchronous-first teams preferred.

Strong experience with FastAPI, PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy, Alembic), Docker, GitHub Actions, and AWS Lambda/ECS. Heavy exposure to OpenXML and `.docx` generation (via `python-docx`, `html2docx`, and XML manipulation). Familiar with frontend codebases (React/TypeScript), observability tooling (Grafana, DataDog), and prompt-tuned OpenAI LLMs (via LlamaIndex). Always reviews AI-generated code.

Currently deepening skills in Terraform, Prometheus, and backend security — aiming for long-term growth toward systems design and staff-level thinking.
